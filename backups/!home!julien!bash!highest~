echo -e -n ${header:+"ALBUMS ARTISTS\n"} # would Print a header line if -h is given
# -e make echo interpret the \n, and -n make echo not printing a linefeed after printing its arguments. Therefore this echo statement won't print nothing, not even a blank line, if header is null.
echo ${album_line:8} #would print only the album name without considering the number in the file.
echo ${album_line:0:7} #would print only the number of album you have.
